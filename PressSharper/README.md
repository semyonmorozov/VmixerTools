# PressSharper

[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/9lta6tnix409s64r?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/bcwood/presssharper)

A C# class library for parsing WordPress XML export data.

Ever had a need to deal with exported WordPress XML data in a .NET project? I have, and since there wasn't a good solution out there already, I decided to create one. The result is PressSharper. It's a simple class library to provide an API to the exported WordPress XML data. 

## Install from NuGet

    Install-Package PressSharper

## Example Usage

To see some good examples of using PressSharper, take a look at the [unit tests](https://github.com/bcwood/PressSharper/blob/master/PressSharper.UnitTests/ParserTests.cs).
